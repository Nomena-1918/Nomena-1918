# Hi there 👋  

## 🚀 About Me  
- Everyone just calls me "Noums" 😉.
- My story with Computer Science began at the end of high school. I was looking for a passionate adventure and new challenges. In that context, IT came **into** my life as an opportunity to seize.  
- Currently enrolled in an international Master’s program in Computer Science, based in Madagascar, my main areas of expertise are **backend development, system design, and relational database design**.  

## 🔭 Current Projects  
- I'm currently working on:  
  - [**Genesis**](https://github.com/superealabs/Genesis): a database-first project generator and JetBrains IDE plugin, aimed at reducing boilerplate code for Java and C#. More technologies are coming soon (^-^).
  - **Mon Refuge**: an integrated ERP for hotel and restaurant management.  

## 🌱 Learning & Interests  
- Deepening my knowledge in system design and scalable microservices architectures.  
- Passionate about backend development, focusing on Spring Boot, .NET Core, PostgreSQL, and Oracle Database. **Currently learning Node.js 🔍 …**  
- Interested in multi-database support and efficient data modeling strategies.  
- Always refining my skills in clean code, SOLID principles, and design patterns to build maintainable and efficient software 💪🏼 .

## 👯 Collaboration & Contributions  
- Open to collaboration on backend development, API design, and database optimization.
- Principal contributor to [**Genesis**](https://github.com/superealabs/Genesis), an open-source project (MIT License) that generates **microservice-based web APIs for CRUD operations**, as well as a **Service Registry with Eureka** and an **API Gateway using Spring Cloud** in Java Spring Boot and .NET Core.
- Genesis introspects a database, extracts metadata, and renders corresponding templates to accelerate MVP development.  
- Always happy to discuss and collaborate on **clean architecture**, scalability, and automation in software development.

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
•	I once created a script to generate code faster… and that script turned into an entire open-source project (Genesis)! 🔥
